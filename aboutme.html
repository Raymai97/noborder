						You might find it funny, but it is true. I was developing noborder for the sake of Touhou games. The window mode of the older ones (such as Touhou PCB) is limited to 640x480 resolution. I believed there must be a better way to scale the game beside of switching to Fullscreen, as I had seen someone else done it for other games. I guessed it has something to be done with Win32 APIs so I thought it is a good opportunity to learn Win32 C++ programming. <p>
						I decided to give a try, see if my idea works. The answer is clear now, and I'm glad it is a positive one. :)<p>
