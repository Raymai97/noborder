						Hi, I am Raymai from Malaysia. I am a Chinese boy, but I know other languages as well, like Malay, English... and Japanese (self-learning lol). I like programming, gaming, watching anime, and trying out new things. Besides that, erm... (I have no idea what to write here now x.x)... I hope you like my work. Douzo Yoroshiku Onegaishimasu!<p>

					<div class="boxTitle">Why was noborder created?</div>
					<div class="boxText">
						You might find it funny, but it is true. I was developing noborder for the sake of Touhou games. The window mode of the older ones (such as Touhou PCB) is limited to 640x480 resolution. I believed there must be a better way to scale the game beside of switching to Fullscreen, as I had seen someone else done it for other games. I guessed it has something to be done with Win32 APIs so I thought it is a good opportunity to learn Win32 C++ programming. <p>
						I decided to give a try, see if my idea works. The answer is clear now, and I'm glad it is a positive one. :)<p>

						Since 2015, I am relying on mobile data for Internet access (3GB per month). For any task that might use a quite amount of quota, I will hold it off and do it only when I have such chance (like going to cybercafe) and I still remember it. As such, I might not be able to response in time. Please bear with me. :/
