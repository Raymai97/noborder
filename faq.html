					<div class="boxText">
						DWM (Desktop Window Manager), first introduced in Windows Vista, is used to render Windows GUI using hardware acceleration. In Vista/Win7, it is only enabled when using Aero theme. Starting by Win8, it is always enabled.<p>
						Why does this matter? Well, many similar utils make the game window borderless by resizing the game window, which works on many Direct3D games, but not working for most non-hardware-accelerated games.<p>
						What makes noborder different from the other util is, it allows you to scale game using DWM. Starting with v1.3, you may choose to use 'DWM formula'. While DWM is running, noborder can make use of DWM to scale window without resizing it, which scales many games perfectly.

					<div class="boxTitle">The window has resized, but the game itself doesn't...</div>
					<div class="boxText">
					Right-click on noborder's Notify Icon, and tick 'DWM formula'. Then, try the hotkey again.<p>
					<span class="note">Note: Currently DWM formula is only ideal for keyboard-only games; many games wouldn't detect the mouse properly when scaling using DWM formula.</span>

					<div class="boxText">
						&bull; Restart noborder.<p>
						&bull; Restart noborder as administrator.<p>
						&bull; Restart your computer.<p>
						&bull; If all else has failed (very unlikely), kindly <a href="./aboutme.html">send me an email</a>, telling me your game name etc.
