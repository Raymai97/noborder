					<div class="boxTitle">What is DWM? Why does it matter?</div>
					<div class="boxText">
						DWM (Desktop Window Manager), first introduced in Windows Vista, is used to render Windows GUI using hardware acceleration. In Vista/Win7, it is only enabled when using Aero theme. Starting by Win8, it is always enabled.<p>
						Why does this matter? Well, many similar utils make the game window borderless by resizing the game window, which works on many Direct3D games, but not working for most non-hardware-accelerated games.<p>
						What makes noborder different from the other util is, it allows you to scale game using DWM. Starting with v1.3, you may choose to use 'DWM formula'. While DWM is running, noborder can make use of DWM to scale window without resizing it, which scales many games perfectly.

				<div class="box">
					<div class="boxTitle">The window has resized, but the game itself doesn't...</div>
					<div class="boxText">
					Right-click on noborder's Notify Icon, and tick 'DWM formula'. Then, try the hotkey again.<p>
					<span class="note">Note: Currently DWM formula is only ideal for keyboard-only games; many games wouldn't detect the mouse properly when scaling using DWM formula.</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<div class="boxTitle">Alt+Backspace (or other hotkey) does nothing! What to do?</div>
					<div class="boxText">
						&bull; Restart noborder.<p>
						&bull; Restart noborder as administrator.<p>
						&bull; Restart your computer.<p>
						&bull; If all else has failed (very unlikely), kindly <a href="./aboutme.html">send me an email</a>, telling me your game name etc.

					<div class="boxTitle">What happened to noborder tiny?</div>
					<div class="boxText">
						I've rewritten the codebase using modern C++, and it doesn't play well with MSVC6.0.<p>
						Initially, I was intentionally using C++ as least as possible in order to make the code compatible with MSVC6.0. Why build with MSVC6.0? Because from user's perspective: <p>
						&bull; Super tiny EXE<br>
						&bull; It just works, no 'XXX.dll is missing' bullshit<p>
						This was why I've made 'noborder tiny', but no more. I still like small EXE but if it means no modern C++, I no longer think it's worth to uncool my code to satisfy MSVC6.0 so I've decided to discontinue it. If you still need it for whatever reason, you may download v1.3.1, which contains both 'noborder' and 'noborder tiny'.<p>
						<span class="note">Note: v1.3.1 of 'noborder tiny' (MSVC6.0 build) has a bug that doesn't exist in 'noborder' (MSVC2015 build). It will crash if the DWM state changed before any 'noborder' option.</span>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="box">
					<div class="boxTitle">Why rewritten in modern C++?</div>
					<div class="boxText">
						For better error-handling, more maintainable, reusable and clean code. It might be PITA in short term, but I think it will lead to a better future. The refactored code is adhere to OOP design and no longer suffer from unnecessary cyclic dependencies. If you read the code, you will be surprised how easily the functionality code can be ported to DLL library if you want to.
